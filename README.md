# Probot: Stale

> a GitHub Integration built with [Probot](https://github.com/probot/probot) that closes abandoned issues after a few months of inactivity.

Inspired by @parkr's [auto-reply](https://github.com/parkr/auto-reply#optional-mark-and-sweep-stale-issues) bot that runs @jekyllbot.

## TODO:

- [x] On an interval:
  - [x] Get all installations & repositories
  - [x] Run mark & sweep
- [x] on relevant issue activity: unmark
- [ ] Get config from repo or org
- [ ] Deploy demo instance
- [ ] Add docs on usage/deployment
- [ ] Release v1.0
